## 📝 Important Notes

1. **GitHub Pages vs Full Application:**
   - https://cmc-creator.github.io/NoxTitan/ = Static HTML demo presentation
   - http://localhost:3000 (after `npm run dev`) = Your actual working NoxTitan application

2. **Why it must run locally:**
   - Requires Node.js server (can't run on GitHub Pages)
   - Requires database (SQLite with 43 models)
   - Dynamic features need server-side processing

3. **All your work is intact:**
   - 70+ pages of features
   - Complete database schema
   - All components and utilities
   - Nothing has been lost
