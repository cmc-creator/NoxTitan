## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see a Settings button"
- Make sure you're logged into GitHub
- Make sure you're on your repository page
- Look at the very top navigation bar

### "Pages section shows 'Upgrade to enable'"
- Your repository needs to be **public** (not private)
- Go to Settings → General → Scroll to bottom
- Click "Change visibility" → Make public

### "My site isn't loading"
- Wait 3-5 minutes after enabling Pages
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Try in an incognito/private window
- Make sure the URL is exactly: `https://cmc-creator.github.io/NoxTitan/`

### "The music doesn't play automatically"
- This is normal! Browsers block autoplay audio
- Users need to click the page first
- Your site already has a button for this - it's working correctly!
