2. **Open Settings:**
   - Click the **Settings** tab (gear icon) in the top menu

3. **Navigate to Pages:**
   - In the left sidebar, scroll down and click **"Pages"**

4. **Configure the Source:**
   - Under **"Build and deployment"**
   - For **"Source"**, select: **GitHub Actions** (from dropdown)
   - Click **Save** if prompted

5. **Wait for Deployment:**
   - The workflow will trigger automatically
   - Look for a green checkmark on the main branch commit

## Step 3: Verify Your Demo is Live

After the workflow completes, your demo will be available at:

```
https://cmc-creator.github.io/NoxTitan/
```

**Test it:**
- Open the URL in your browser
- You should see the NoxTitan Executive Demo
- The demo includes interactive slides with music

## 📁 What Gets Deployed

The workflow deploys these files to GitHub Pages (if they exist):
- ✅ `index.html` (main demo page - **required**)
- ✅ `demo-interactive.html`
- ✅ `demo-noxtitan-final.html`
- ✅ `demo-self-contained.html`
- ✅ `demo-music.mp3`
- ✅ `landing/` directory contents (available at `/landing/`)
- ✅ `demo/` directory contents (available at `/demo/`)

**Not deployed** (workflow only copies specific files):
- ❌ Large logo files (noxtitan-logo.mp4, noxtitan-logo.png, logo-base64.txt)
- ❌ Node modules
- ❌ Source code (`src/` directory)
- ❌ Build artifacts (.next/, etc.)
- ❌ Database files (prisma/dev.db)

**Note:** The `demo/` directory has its own `index.html` accessible at `/demo/index.html`, while the root `index.html` serves as the main page at the root URL.

---

## 🔄 Automatic Updates

The workflow is configured to:
- ✅ Deploy automatically when you push to the `main` branch
- ✅ Support manual deployment via "Actions" tab → "Deploy to GitHub Pages" → "Run workflow"
