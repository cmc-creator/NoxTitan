### Will I ever be charged?
**NO!** There are no hidden fees, no trial periods, and no surprise charges. GitHub Pages is genuinely free for public repositories.

### What if I want a custom domain (like www.noxtitan.com)?
- GitHub Pages hosting: Still **FREE**
- Custom domain: ~$10-15/year (optional, from domain registrars like Namecheap)
